# Gobblet

# ABSTRACT

The use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to master the game of Gobblet.
Gobblet is a strategic board game played on a 4x4 board with twelve pieces of varying sizes per
player. The objective is to form a row of four pieces, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. To
propose and implement a deep reinforcement learning approach that models the game as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), with states representing board positions, actions representing
piece placement or movement, and rewards indicating game outcomes. The method employs a
deep Q-network (DQN) to approximate the state-action value function and is trained using
experience replay and target networks for improved stability. Through analysis of the learned
policy, insights into the agent's strategy is inferred. It is observed that the agent learns to
prioritize protecting its own pieces while simultaneously obstructing its opponent's pieces. These
results highlight the effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning for achieving high-level
gameplay in Gobblet. This approach has the potential to be extended to other strategy board
games and can contribute to the development of advanced game-playing agents.
